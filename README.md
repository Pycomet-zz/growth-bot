<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project

This is a custom built telegram bot script application to add users embedded in a User Friendly process oriented bot to handle the onbarding and smooth flow of the service provided. Which is extracting users from specified target groups and adding them into the user's own group.

### Here are the processes followed

After initiating the `/start` command;

1.  The bot requests for the group you would like to extract members from ? (it has to be a group with members and not a channel with subscribers)

2.  The bot requests for an index point to start the adding process from. This basically helps you start off from where you left off the previous day after extract from the group used in `step 1`.

NOW IS THE BOT'S TURN ü§ì

1.  Th first thing the bot does is fetch all the client sessions it has access to as preconfigured. All into a list.

2.  Using each of the sessions, one at a time. The bot used the client user to add the extracted user into the target group with a maximum of 50 on each client (Maximum number of adds per day).

The index is always registered to the runtime memory, so whichever the client that is used. The application is not going over the same users twice.

... And after all is done, the bot signifies, the number of users added, the number of failed attempts and finally says bye, hoping to see you in around 24hours.
